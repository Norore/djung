Boilerplate for Django projects

This boilerplate sets u a standard Django project along with common components.

These components are:

- [Django Compressor](http://django_compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
- [South](http://south.aeracode.org/)
- [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org)

Some frontend components are also shipped inside the project:
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Reusable frontend components are installed with [bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower)
inside the 'components' folder.



Note to other Django boilerplate authors: Please stop putting your Django apps
in a separate "apps" folder.
